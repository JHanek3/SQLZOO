1.Write the code that shows the name, region and population of the smallest country in each region

SELECT x.name, x.region, x.population
    FROM bbc AS x
   WHERE x.population <=  ALL(SELECT y.population FROM bbc AS y WHERE b.region = a.region)

#Input answer
SELECT region, name, population
    FROM bbc AS x
   WHERE population <= ALL(SELECT population FROM bbc AS y WHERE y.region = x.region AND population > 0)

2.
Write the code that shows the countries belonging to regions with all populations over 50000

SELECT x.name, x.region, x.population
    FROM bbc AS x
   WHERE 50000 < ALL(SELECT population from bbc AS y WHERE y.region = x.region AND y.population > 0)

#Input answer
SELECT name, region, population
    FROM bbc x
   WHERE 50000< ALL(SELECT population FROM bbc y WHERE x.region = y.region AND y.population > 0)

3.
Select the code that shows the countries with a less than a third of the population around it

SELECT x.name, x.region
    FROM bbc AS x
   WHERE x.population < ALL (SELECT population / 3 FROM bbc AS y WHERE x.region = y.region AND y.name != x.name)

4.
Write the result that would be obtained from the following code
SELECT name FROM bbc
    WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM bbc WHERE name = 'United Kingdom') AND region IN (SELECT region FROM bbc
                        WHERE name = 'United Kingdom')
!It's going to show names where the population is greater than UK and the in the same region as UK

France
Germany
Russia
Turkey

5.
Write the code that would show the countries with a greater GDP than any country in Africa (some countries may
have NULL gdp values)

SELECT name FROM bbc WHERE gdp > ALL(SELECT gdp FROM bbc WHERE region = 'Africa' AND gdp > 0)
!I think this works, but you can make it shorter by just finding the max gdp!

#Input Answer
SELECT name
    FROM bbc
   WHERE gdp > (SELECT(MAX(gdp) FROM bbc WHERE region = 'Africa')

6.
Write the code that shows the countries with population smaller than Russia but bigger than Denmark

SELECT name
    FROM bbc
   WHERE population < (SELECT population FROM bbc WHERE name = 'Russia')
   AND population > (SELECT population FROM bbc WHERE name = 'Denmark')

7.
What would be the result from the following code
SELECT name FROM bbc
WHERE population > ALL(SELECT MAX(population) FROM bbc WHERE region = 'Europe') AND region = 'South Asia'
# So the result needs to have more people than the max population in Europe and be apart of South Asia

Bangladesh
India
Pakistan
