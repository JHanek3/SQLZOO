Join allows you to use data from two or more tables

1.
Modify the code to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany.
SELECT * FROM goal WHERE player LIKE '%Bender'

SELECT matchid, player
    FROM goal
   WHERE teamid = 'Ger'

2.
Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012

SELECT id, stadium, team1, team2
    FROM game
   WHERE id = 1012

3.
SELECT * FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
FROM clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table
ON says how to figure out which rows in game go with which rows in goal
    matchid from goal must match id from game
    ON (game.id=goal.matchid)
Modify the code to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every german goal
SELECT player, stadium
    FROM game
    JOIN goal on (id=match)

SELECT player, teamid, stadium, mdate
    FROM game
    JOIN goal ON (id=matchid AND teamid = 'GER')

4.
Use the same JOIN as in the previous question
Show the team1, team2, and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario

SELECT team1, team2, player
    FROM game
    JOIN goal ON (id=matchid AND player LIKE 'Mario%')

5.
The table eteam gives details of every national team including the coach. You can join goal to eteam using the
phrase goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id.
Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtimes <= 10

SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
    FROM goal
   JOIN eteam ON (teamid=id AND gtime <= 10)

6.
To JOIN game with eteam you could use wither
game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id) or game JOIN eteam ON (team2=eteam.id)

List the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach

SELECT mdate, teamname
    FROM game
   JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id AND coach LIKE '%Santos')

7.
List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

SELECT player
    FROM goal
   JOIN game ON (goal.matchid=game.id AND stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw')

8.
The example query shows all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal
Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany
SELECT player, gtime
    FROM game
   JOIN goal on matchid = id
    WHERE (team1='GER' and team2='GRE')

SELECT DISTINCT(player)
    FROM game
      JOIN goal ON matchid = id
    WHERE ((team1='GER' or team2='GER') AND teamid != 'Ger')

9.
Show teamname and the total number of goals scored

SELECT teamname, COUNT(player)
    FROM eteam
      JOIN goal ON id=teamid
    GROUP BY teamname

10.
Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in the stadium

SELECT stadium, COUNT(player)
    FROM game
      JOIN goal ON (matchid=id)
    GROUP BY stadium

11.
For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored

SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(player) AS goals
    FROM game
      JOIN goal ON (matchid=id AND (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL'))
    GROUP BY matchid, mdate

12.
For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'

SELECT id, mdate, COUNT(player)
    FROM game
      JOIN goal ON (matchid=id AND (team1='GER' or team2= 'GER') AND teamid='GER')
    GROUP by id, mdate

13.
List every match with goals scored by each team shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in
any previous exercises

SELECT mdate,
       team1,
       SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score1,
       team2,
       SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score2 FROM
    game LEFT JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
    GROUP BY mdate,team1,team2
    ORDER BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2
