1.
List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'

SELECT name
    FROM world
   WHERE population >
        (SELECT population FROM world
         Where name = 'Russia')

2.
Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than the 'United Kingdom'

SELECT name
    FROM world
   WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp/ population >
    (SELECT gdp / population FROM world
    WHERE name = 'United Kingdom')

3.
List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name
of the country

SELECT name, continent
    FROM world
   WHERE continent IN ('South America', 'Oceania')
    ORDER BY name

4.
Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than poland?
Show the name and population

SELECT name, population
    FROM world
   WHERE population > name = 'Canada' AND population < name = 'Poland'
!This does not work, you need to use select statements (varies slightly from Python)!

SELECT name, population
    FROM world
   WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Canada') AND
    population < (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Poland')

5.
Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the
population of germany

SELECT name, population
    FROM world
   WHERE population / (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany')
!This does not work!
Time to introduce CONCAT, which brings together multiple inputs

SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND(population/(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany') * 100.0), '%')
    FROM world
   WHERE continent = 'Europe'
! The top line is where the magic happens we divide the population of the country by Germany, round that to two
decimal places, multiply by 100 to make it a percentage. CONCAT it to add a percentage at the end

6.
Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe?

SELECT name
    FROM world
   WHERE gdp > ALL(SELECT gdp FROM world WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp > 0)
!All returns true if all of the subquery values meet the condition!
!So here it returns all gdp values for Europe and when there is a value!

7.
Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, name, area

SELECT x.continent, x.name, x.area
    FROM world AS x
   WHERE x.area = (
    SELECT MAX(y.area)
    FROM world AS y
    WHERE x.continent = y.continent)

8.
List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically

SELECT continent, name
    FROM world AS x
   WHERE name = (
    SELECT name
    FROM world AS y
    WHERE x.continent = y.continent
    ORDER BY name ASC
    LIMIT 1)

9.
Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries
associated with these continents. Show the name, continent, and population

SELECT x.name, x.continent, x.population
    FROM world  AS x
    WHERE 25000000 > ALL (
    SELECT y.population
    FROM world AS y
    WHERE x.continent = y.continent)

10.
Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent).
Give countries and continents

SELECT x.name, x.continent
    FROM world AS x
    WHERE population / 3 > ALL (
    SELECT y.population
    FROM world AS y
    WHERE x.continent = y.continent
    AND x.name != y.name)
